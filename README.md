## üåü Projects Included

1.  **Project 4: Visualizing Data as a Bar Chart**
    *   **Description:** Demonstrates creating a bar chart to visualize sample data (e.g., "Bi·ªÉu m·∫´u" - Sample). It utilizes `BarChart` and `XYChart.Series` for data representation.
    *   **Key Learnings:** Basic chart creation, data series setup, axis configuration.

2.  **Project 5: Create a Multi-Chain Line Chart**
    *   **Description:** Shows how to create a line chart with multiple data series (e.g., "High Temperature" and "Low Temperature"). Includes a legend and axis labels.
    *   **Key Learnings:** Multi-series charts, `LineChart`, legends, styling chart elements.

3.  **Project 6: Drawing a Spiral Shell (Spirograph Pattern)**
    *   **Description:** Focuses on custom 2D graphics rendering by programmatically drawing a geometric spiral or spirograph-like pattern using `Line` segments.
    *   **Key Learnings:** Custom drawing on `Canvas` or with Shapes, trigonometric functions for path generation, loops for repetitive drawing.

4.  **Project 7: Animating a Shape (Moving Square)**
    *   **Description:** Introduces basic animation principles in JavaFX by animating a `Rectangle` (square) using `TranslateTransition` to move it across the screen.
    *   **Key Learnings:** `Transition` API, animating properties (translation), basic motion graphics.

5.  **Project 8: Animating a Bouncing Ball**
    *   **Description:** Demonstrates more advanced animation with simple physics by creating a ball (`Circle`) that bounces off the window boundaries.
    *   **Key Learnings:** `Timeline` and `KeyFrame` for continuous animation, collision detection, updating object properties over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools Used

*   **Programming Language:** Java (JDK 11 or newer recommended)
*   **GUI Framework:** JavaFX (Version 11 or newer, corresponding to the JDK)
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
*   **Build System:** (Implicitly IntelliJ IDEA's built-in system; can be adapted for Maven or Gradle if needed)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or later.
*   **JavaFX SDK:** Download the JavaFX SDK appropriate for your OS and JDK version from [GluonHQ](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
*   **IntelliJ IDEA:** Community or Ultimate Edition.

## üöÄ Getting Started & Running the Projects

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Open in IntelliJ IDEA:**
    *   Open IntelliJ IDEA.
    *   Select "Open" and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

3.  **Configure JDK:**
    *   Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`.
    *   Ensure an appropriate JDK (11+) is selected for the "Project SDK".

4.  **Configure JavaFX:**
    *   Go to `File > Project Structure > Libraries`.
    *   Click the `+` sign and select "Java".
    *   Navigate to the `lib` folder of your downloaded JavaFX SDK and add it as a library.
    *   For each project's run configuration (especially if you are *not* using a modular project structure with `module-info.java`):
        *   Go to `Run > Edit Configurations...`.
        *   For each application (e.g., `Project4Application`), in the "VM options" field, add the following (adjust the path to your JavaFX SDK):
            ```
            --module-path /path/to/your/javafx-sdk-xx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics
            ```
            *(You might need to add other JavaFX modules like `javafx.media`, `javafx.swing`, `javafx.web` depending on the specific project's needs, though the listed ones are common).*
        *   If your projects use `module-info.java`, ensure they `requires` the necessary JavaFX modules.

5.  **Running a Specific Project:**
    *   Navigate to the source code of the project you want to run (e.g., `src/com/example/project4/Project4Application.java`).
    *   Locate the main class containing the `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
    *   Right-click on the main class file or within the editor on the `main` method.
    *   Select "Run 'ApplicationName.main()'".

## ‚ú® Essential Elements for a Robust Java/Kotlin Project (General Good Practices)

While these projects are implemented in Java, many good software development practices apply universally, including to Kotlin projects:

*   **Clear Project Structure:** Organize files and packages logically.
*   **Meaningful Naming:** Use descriptive names for classes, methods, and variables.
*   **Code Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
*   **Version Control (Git):** Track changes, collaborate, and manage project history.
*   **Dependency Management:** For larger projects, use tools like Maven or Gradle to manage external libraries. (These demo projects might not heavily rely on this).
*   **Modular Design:** Break down the application into smaller, manageable, and reusable components/modules.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper exception handling.
*   **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and correctness.
*   **Code Readability and Maintainability:** Follow coding conventions and strive for clean code.

## üéØ Applications & Purpose

These projects serve multiple purposes:

*   **Learning JavaFX:** Provides hands-on experience with core JavaFX concepts.
*   **Data Visualization:** Demonstrates how to present data graphically using charts.
*   **2D Graphics:** Explores custom drawing capabilities for creating visuals.
*   **Animation:** Introduces techniques for bringing UIs to life with motion.
*   **Understanding GUI Architecture:** Helps in understanding event handling, scene graphs, and the overall structure of a JavaFX application.
*   **Foundation:** Acts as a starting point for developing more sophisticated desktop applications for various domains like data analysis tools, simple games, educational software, or utility applications.
